  HAIKU4U is a simple, elegant, and playful web application that generates random haikus...ENDLESSLY! It was built by parsing Andre Breton's Surrealist Manifesto and separating each nonrepeating word into arrays assigned by their estimated syllable count. The Python algorithm used to estimate syllable counts is not always correct, so the results may not appear in the 5-7-5 format that most are used to (UPDATE: The alogrithm used for each line has been edited to return a structure closer to 5-8-4). You can use the application at ya1sec.github.io/haikugenerator

  ## Installation

  This application requires no installation! It is currently only a web application and can be used on any browser.


  ## Usage

  ## Contributing

  At the current stage, any contributions regarding a more precise method to estimate syllables would be greatly appreciated. In a future iteration, HAIKU4U may exist as a mobile/desktop app, and contributions will be welcome.


  ## Tests

    Refer to the usage instructions above and run through the application several times to get familiar with its output. Please reach out if you happen to encounter any significant bugs or errors.
