## Installation

The application depends on the Inquirer package, which can be installed in the command line by typing npm i inquirer. Navigate to the project's directory on the machine, and move into the "Develop" folder. Type node index.js to run the application

## Usage

     When you run the program, you are presented with prompts asking you to enter information about your project. This includes: Title, Description, Installation, Usage, Licensing, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. Once youhave completed these prompts, the application will process your inputs as markdown and write it into a README.md file in the Develop folder. You can then edit anything you may need to change, and move it to your project's root directory

## Contributing

This project is currently not seeking any contributions, but I do encourage clones and forks!

## Tests

    Refer to the usage instructions above and run through the application several times to get familiar with its output.
